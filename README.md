- Download Git in your system : [ðŸ‘‰Download from hereðŸ‘ˆ](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
  
### Setup Git
For Git to work properly, we need to let it know who we are so that it can link a local Git user (you) to GitHub. When working on a team, this allows people to see what you have committed and who committed each line of code.

- Open any terminal or command prompt and enter the below commands. The commands below will configure Git. Be sure to enter your own information inside the quotes.

```sh
git config --global user.name usernamehere
git config --global user.email yourmailhere@example.com
```

- To verify that things are working properly, enter these commands and verify whether the output matches your name and email address.

```  
git config --get user.name
git config --get user.email
```
